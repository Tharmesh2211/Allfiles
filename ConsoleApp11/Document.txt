Question : 

Imagine you are developing a console application for a school management system. 

Implement a simple CRUD system to manage a list of students assigned to a teacher. 

Each student should have a name, roll number ,gender, date of birth, address and grade.
 
Create a Student: Allow the teacher to input a student's name, roll number, gender, date of birth, 
address and grade, and add each Student in the List .
 
Read All Students: Display a list of all students assigned to the teacher with their names, roll numbers,
and grades.
 
Read Student by Roll Number: Prompt the teacher to enter the roll number of a student and display the details 
of that specific student.
 
Update Student Grade: Prompt the teacher to enter the roll number of a student whose grade they want to update. 
If the student exists, allow the teacher to update the student's grade.
 
Delete Student: Prompt the teacher to enter the roll number of a student to be removed from the list.
 
Exit the Program: Provide an option to exit the program.
 
Use a class to represent a student, and store the students in a list assigned to a specific teacher. 
Ensure that the program handles user input gracefully, providing appropriate messages for success or failure.

Step 1 : Create Classes For the Program

		Teacher class : Contains Teacher Properties (Teacher ID, Teacher Name).
		Here Teacher ID act as a Primary Key.
		
		Student class : Contains Student Properties (RollNo, Name, DOB, etc).
		Additionally you add Teacher ID (Property) for Student class, 
		Because Teacher can easily identify their student when you have your Teacher ID. 
		
		Here Teacher ID act as a Foreign Key.
		
Step 2 : Create Interface For Both Student and Teacher class.

		These interface Contains only CRUD Methods.
		
		Interface Name : IStudent, ITeacher
		Istudent Methods(CreateStudent, ReadStudent, UpdateStudent, DeleteStudent).
		ITeacher Methods(CreateTeacher, ReadTeacher, UpdateTeacher, DeleteTeacher).
		
Step 3 : Write some Logics for Both Student and Teacher Seperately.
		
		Create Two Class Called StudentList and TeacherList.
		
		StudentList class inherites IStudent interface.
		TeacherList class inherites ITeacher interface.
		
		After that write your logics inside the methods which you have inherited from your interface.
		
step 4 : Create One more class and Interface called TeacherStudent and ITeacherStudent(CRUD methods).
		
		Inside the TeacherStudent class you should combine the class StudentList and TeacherList.
		Here only you should do the real CRUD Operation.
		
Step 5 : Inside the Main Class Create a instance for TeacherStudent class.
		After that call the Methods you want.
